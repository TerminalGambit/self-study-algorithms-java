# Self Study of Algorithms in Java

## 1. [Introduction](#1-introduction)

The purpose of this repository is to store the algorithms that I am studying during summer break.
Why am I studying algorithms during summer break? Because I want to improve my problem-solving skills and I want to be able to solve problems more efficiently.

## 2. [Organization](#2-organization)

I am learning from a book called "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. I will be following the chapters of the book and implementing the algorithms in Java in this repository and in Python in the other repository.
My organisation will be as follows:
- Each chapter will have its own folder.
- Each subchapter will have its own folder.
- Each algorithm will have its own folder.
- Each algorithm will have its own README.md file explaining the algorithm and its implementation.
